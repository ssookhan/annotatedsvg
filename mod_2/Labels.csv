temps,temperatures,Temperature,"The internal temperature of Earth changes with depth, a property called the geothermal gradient. The core is the hottest part of the Earth and it conductively transfers hear to the mantle. The mantle is cooler than the core by over a thousand degrees Kelvin but maintains a gentle geothermal gradient because convection of the mantle homogenizes the temperature gradient and causes heat to be lost to the surface. The lithosphere occurs above about 1000 K where mantle cools enough to become rigid. ",,"Temperature.The internal temperature of Earth changes with depth, a property called the geothermal gradient.

temps,density,Density,"The internal density profile of the Earth is a result of the compositional properties of different layers and the temperature and pressure profile with depth. The silicate minerals of the mantle and crust are much less dense than the iron-nickel alloys of the core. Similarly the crust is less dense than the mantle because has more silica, while the mantle has a higher concentration of heavy elements like iron and magnesium. Generally the density increases with depth because increased weight of materials lying above forces the compression of the rock material.
