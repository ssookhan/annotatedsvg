Labelled,Kettlepoint,Kettle Point Formation,Black shale deposited in the deep anoxic waters of the Michigan Basin. Mud was derived from the weathering of the Acadian Range. The sediment was extensively bioturbated by organisms living on the seafloor. These rocks are excellent source rocks for oil and gas.,,"Kettle Point Formation.Black shale deposited in the deep, anoxic waters of the Michigan Basin.
